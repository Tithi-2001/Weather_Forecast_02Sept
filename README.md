# 🌦 Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI  

### 📖 Project Description  
A **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes **weather forecast data** with interactive charts and slicers.  
- 🔗 Data fetched from online sources and transformed using Power Query.  
- 📊 Built measures and visuals to analyze **average temperatures and daily trends**.  
- 🎯 Designed for **dynamic filtering** to view overall or day-specific forecasts.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is focused on building a **Weather Forecast Report Dashboard** using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides interactive visualizations of forecasted weather parameters such as **temperature trends, daily variations, and average conditions**. It demonstrates how external data sources can be fetched, transformed, and presented in a meaningful and user-friendly way.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Fetch real-time weather data from online resources.  
- Clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for weather insights.  
- Enhance skills in **data visualization, DAX, and slicer-based interactivity**.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools Used  

### **Data Sourcing**  
- Weather data collected from **online APIs / CSV / web resources**.  
- Connected data to Power BI using **Get Data (Web connector)**.  

### **Data Transformation**  
- Cleaned and formatted data in **Power Query Editor**.  
- Converted text-based date fields into **Date/Time** format.  
- Handled missing or inconsistent values.  

### **Data Modeling**  
- Built relationships between tables (if applicable).  
- Created **calculated columns and measures** such as:  
  - Average forecast temperature  
  - Daily and weekly trends  
  - Day-wise filtering  

### **Dashboard Design**  
- Created **line charts** for average forecast temperature.  
- Added **button slicers** for day selection.  
- Applied conditional formatting for clear insights.  
- Dashboard shows:  
  - **Overall trend** (when no slicer selected)  
  - **Day-specific forecast** (when slicer selected)
